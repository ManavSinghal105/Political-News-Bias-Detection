But the historian David W. Blight makes an argument that the first such observance was in fact the work of newly freed Black people seeking to honor the 40,000\\u00a0African American soldiers who died in the war. The tribute consisted of elaborate ceremonies, parades, prayers, scripture readings and speeches. The Black soldiers deserved the honor: They gave their lives for the most American of causes, freedom and Union. It\\u2019s good, though, that they had such attention lavished on them then, because fairly soon afterward, they faded from much of the nation\\u2019s memory, as did their cause.Instead, over time in the late 19th\\u00a0century, many such observances of this day of remembrance became occasions for unreconstructed Confederates to advance what became known as the Lost Cause, a willful displacement of actual history by a mythology meant to justify the rebellion and all but deify its leaders. They portrayed Southern soldiers as chivalrous and brave but unable to overcome Yankee numbers and industrial might. They spoke of a Southern \\u201cnation\\u201d united against Northern \\u201caggression,\\u201d and of the happiness and contentment of their enslaved \\u201cservants.\\u201d The military genius of Robert E.\\u00a0Lee and the virtue and necessity of white supremacy were extolled.Missing from most versions of this tale was any semblance of reality, including such things as the opposition to secession shared by many thousands of southern Whites who benefited little or not at all from the slave economy. The horrors of slavery were all but ignored. The great tragedy was that so much of this myth made its way into the public consciousness, North and South, contributing to a century of repression and racial discrimination that mocked Abraham Lincoln\\u2019s hope \\u2014 voiced among the soldiers\\u2019 graves at Gettysburg \\u2014 that their deaths would not be in vain but would bring a new birth of freedom.On a Memorial Day 58 years after that speech, White mobs in Tulsa engaged in one of the worst riots in American history, in which an unknown number of Black people were killed and the city\\u2019s thriving Black business district destroyed. Among those trying to stop the mob was a sizable contingent of African American World War I veterans. On the other side were numerous White veterans.That same year, 1921, the nation\\u2019s attention turned to a ceremony on a hillside overlooking the nation\\u2019s capital: the interment of an unknown soldier of the Great War, one of many thousands whose remains could not be identified. The dignified passage of the soldier\\u2019s casket from France to Arlington National Cemetery was closely followed by millions of Americans, and many thousands came to view the interment on Nov. 11, 1921.\\u201cToday, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is as solid in the public psyche as its massive marble slabs are heavy on the hallowed ground,\\u201d Steve Hendrix wrote in The Post a few years ago. \\u201cThe resting place of one \\u2018soldier known but to God\\u2019 sits at the center of national remembrance.\\u201dPart of that remembrance should include words spoken in Congress by Hamilton Fish Jr., a Republican representative from New York who had commanded a Black unit in the Great War. The purpose, he said, was \\u201cto bring home the body of an unknown American warrior who in himself represents no section, creed, or race in the late war and who typifies, moreover, the soul of America and the supreme sacrifice of her heroic dead.\\u201dA century later, that is still the standard for a true Memorial Day.Read more:\",\n          \"WASHINGTON\\u2014The House Judiciary Committee said it would vote Wednesday on whether to hold Attorney General         William Barr    in contempt of Congress, escalating a dispute with the         Trump    administration after Mr. Barr missed lawmakers\\u2019 deadline to turn over an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller\\u2019s report.If the panel, chaired by Rep.         Jerrold Nadler    (D., N.Y.), approves the resolution, as expected, it would then need to be approved by the full House. The contempt measure refers Mr. Barr for possible federal criminal prosecution while also opening more legal avenues for House Democrats to try to force the release of the full report on President Trump and Russian election interference through a civil lawsuit. \\u201cThe Attorney General\\u2019s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,\\u201d Mr. Nadler said. \\u201cIf the Department presents us with a good faith offer for access to the full report and the underlying evidence, I reserve the right to postpone these proceedings.\\u201d     The Judiciary Committee had set a Monday deadline for the Justice Department to comply with a subpoena, first issued April 19, for the entire special counsel report as well as underlying evidence. Mr. Barr testified before a Senate panel last Wednesday and had been scheduled to appear before a House panel the next day, but he canceled that appearance over a squabble with House Democrats over the hearing\\u2019s format.               Separately, Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday that Mr. Mueller shouldn\\u2019t testify before Congress after two days earlier saying that decision should be up to the attorney general. Mr. Barr, for his part, had previously said he had no objection to such testimony, and congressional panels had been working with a representative of Mr. Mueller\\u2019s to work that out.      The scheduling of the contempt vote is the latest manifestation of the increasing tension between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats. At issue is Mr. Barr\\u2019s handling of the public rollout of Mr. Mueller\\u2019s findings on whether Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 campaign coordinated with Russians trying to disrupt the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in the investigation.      Last week, House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        accused Mr. Barr of having misled Congress about the findings in recent weeks.        \\nShare Your ThoughtsHow do you think the standoff between Congress and Attorney General William Barr will be resolved? Join the conversation below.        The Justice Department says it is legally barred from turning over the full report because it contains information obtained by using a grand jury, which is by law secret. It has also maintained that Congress has no right to demand raw evidence gathered in a criminal probe.     Courts have ordered grand jury material to be released to Congress in previous investigations involving presidents, as in during Watergate and the Clinton impeachment. The committee has urged Mr. Barr to request a court unseal the Mueller report\\u2014a step he hasn\\u2019t taken.     The department has also said it has already accommodated public interest in the report by releasing a redacted version to the public and making a less redacted version available to senior congressional leaders.     The Justice Department on Monday invited congressional leaders to the department for further negotiations over the impasse.      \\u201cThe Department remains willing to accommodate Congress\\u2019s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law,\\u201d said a department spokeswoman.              Rep. Doug Collins    of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary committee, called the action by Democrats \\u201cillogical and disingenuous\\u201d and suggested that the panel should instead pass legislation allowing grand jury information to be turned over to Congress.                                         The fight between House Democrats and the Trump administration in the aftermath of Robert Mueller's report is getting increasingly tense. What will come next? WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains. Photos: AP                                                                                                     \\u201cDemocrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,\\u201d Mr. Collins said.     While Mr. Mueller\\u2019s report outlined efforts by Mr. Trump to curtail or shut down the probe, the special counsel didn\\u2019t pursue charges of obstruction of justice on Mr. Trump, citing in part Justice Department guidance. He also didn\\u2019t establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government despite repeated contacts with Moscow-linked entities in 2016.     A contempt citation from Congress of a senior administration official is a rare, but not unheard of, action in disputes over documents or testimony.\\u00a0In most circumstances, the department has policies against bringing criminal charges against its own officials in clashes with Congress and has historically declined to act on such requests.     But moving forward on contempt also paves the way for a potential civil lawsuit to gain access to the report. Courts have rarely had to grapple with the legal boundaries of such disputes. They have generally recognized the right of Congress to compel testimony and documents as part of its oversight function\\u2014as well as the right of the executive branch to shield some sensitive material from disclosure to Capitol Hill or the public.     Such litigation could take years.     Former Attorney General         Eric Holder    was held in contempt in 2012 after refusing congressional requests for access to documents about a law-enforcement program called \\u201cFast and Furious.\\u201d Mr. Holder invoked the executive privilege doctrine to shield some documents from Congress, provoking the GOP-led panel to hold him in contempt.     The Justice Department unsurprisingly declined criminal contempt charges against its own leader. Republicans then filed a civil lawsuit, in which they prevailed on a number of questions. When it took power, the Trump administration moved to settle the suit and turn over some of the documents\\u2014but the case still isn\\u2019t fully resolved and a settlement remains pending.     Democrats last week also hinted they could revive a dormant power of Congress called inherent contempt, in which Congress either levies fines or physically detains a recalcitrant witness. Such a step would be unprecedented in modern relations between Congress and the executive branch, though courts have repeatedly upheld the congressional power to arrest witnesses who defy subpoenas.

All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\",\n          \"The FBI has confirmed that Anthony Warner, 63, was the culprit behind a Christmas Day bombing in downtown Nashville.       \\\"Based on the evidence that we got at this point, we\\u2019ve come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber,\\\" U.S. Attorney Don Cochran said, adding that Warner perished in the explosion.            The explosion left at least three people hospitalized and 41 businesses damaged \\u2014 perhaps most significantly an AT&T facility adjacent to where the RV that exploded was positioned. The blast caused outages in parts of Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky and affected services ranging from residential phones to 911 services.      Tennessee Bureau of Investigations Director David Rausch acknowledged the \\\"collaborative effort\\\" that took place to conduct the investigation and the \\\"agents, analysts, and scientists that have been assisting in this investigation from the start.\\\"      Rausch said Warner's identity was confirmed based on DNA testing conducted from human remains found at the crime scene and a sample taken from a vehicle used by Warner. \\\"At approximately midnight Central Time, forensic scientists with TBI confirmed a match of the DNA at both locations belonging to the person of interest in this case,\\\" Rausch said. \\\"TBI continues to support this ongoing investigation.\\\"      Special Agent Doug Korneski added that the bureau was still following leads but reaffirmed that it has found no evidence that any other individuals participated in the planning or execution of the attack.       \\\"We\\u2019re still following leads right now,\\\" Korneski said. \\\"There is no indication that any other persons were involved. We reviewed hours of security video surrounding the recreational vehicle as well. We saw no other people involved around that vehicle.\\\"       Korneski said investigators were able to recover a vehicle identification number that traced the detonated RV to Warner.       The FBI indicated that the DNA testing relied on DNA from a member of Warner's family to confirm the match so rapidly.                       The FBI indicates that there was DNA gathered from one of Warner's relatives which helped them with the DNA comparison.Also, TBI says there was NO prior contact with Warner and law enforcement.\\u2014 Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) December 27, 2020                             Investigators have yet to comment on potential motivations behind the explosion, but speculation has surfaced that it could have been because of paranoia regarding 5G technology. A real estate agent named Steve Fridrich told Newsweek that he contacted the FBI about a man he previously worked with named Tony Warner. Fridrich has said the FBI asked him if Warner was paranoid about 5G technology being used to spy on people.      Warner reportedly worked for Fridich's company, Fridrich & Clark Realty office, as \\u201ccontract laborer for computer consulting for the company,\\u201d according to the Tennessean.      Investigators are also reportedly looking into whether the previous employment of Warner's father could have been a motivation. Charles Warner worked for BellSouth before he died in 2011. BellSouth was merged into AT&T in 2006.      Korneski said the FBI was still investigating \\\"any and all possible motives\\\" and that the bureau was questioning people who knew Warner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
